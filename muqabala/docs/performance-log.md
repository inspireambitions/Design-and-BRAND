# Performance log

Target: `trymuqabala.com`. Goals: first streamed feedback under 1.5 s at p75, employer report under 2 s at p75, Core Web Vitals passing on a mid-range Android over throttled 3G.

Sections are worked in the order of the performance brief. A lower section does not start until the one above has passed its acceptance test on production data.

Hard rules that no entry here may change: candidate practice video never leaves the device. No scoring of face, accent, emotion or personality. Scores are never shown before the integrity gate has run.

## How to read the numbers

Real-user timings are PostHog events, one event per measurement, all in milliseconds:

| Event | Measures | Sent from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `feedback_first_token_ms` | Get feedback tap to the first readable block on screen | `components/InterviewFlow.tsx` |
| `feedback_complete_ms` | Get feedback tap to the final feedback (or timeout or error, see `outcome`) | `components/InterviewFlow.tsx` |
| `advert_to_first_question_ms` | Advert submitted to tailored questions returned | `components/CustomRoleStart.tsx` |
| `transcript_ready_ms` | Stop speaking to transcript shown | `components/InterviewFlow.tsx` |
| `report_load_ms` | Navigation start to employer report interactive | `app/employer/interviews/[id]/page.tsx` |
| `web_vital` | LCP, INP, CLS, FCP, TTFB with `rating` and route `path` | `components/WebVitals.tsx` |

Every event carries `device_class` (mobile, tablet, desktop). PostHog adds country from the request. `streamed` on the feedback events separates the baseline from the streamed path.

Dashboard: in PostHog create one insight per event, Trends, property `duration_ms` (or `value` for `web_vital`), aggregations p50, p75, p95, broken down by `device_class` and `$geoip_country_code`. Filter `web_vital` by `metric`. Save the six insights to a dashboard named "Muqabala performance".

## Test protocol

Run before and after each section.

- Device: mid-range Android, or Chrome DevTools mobile emulation with 4x CPU slowdown.
- Network: Chrome DevTools "Slow 3G".
- Location: Middle East node on WebPageTest (Dubai, Riyadh or Doha).
- Candidate flow: land on `/practice`, pick a role, answer by typing, Get feedback, Retry, view the comparison.
- Employer flow: sign in, open a report with video.

## Log

Format: date, section, metric, before, after, source.

### 2026-09-01, Section 8, measurement

| Metric | Before | After | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Events instrumented | 3 product events, no timings, no vitals | 3 product events plus 5 timings plus `web_vital` | this branch |
| Dashboard | none | to create in PostHog from the table above | manual step |

Status: code complete. Dashboard creation and the baseline capture happen on production, not from this environment.

### 2026-09-01, Section 1, streaming feedback

Baseline: not yet captured. Deploy this branch with `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEEDBACK_STREAMING=off` for one full day of real traffic, note p75 of `feedback_first_token_ms` and `feedback_complete_ms` here, then switch the variable to `on` (or remove it) and capture the same figures.

| Metric | Before (baseline) | After (streamed) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `feedback_first_token_ms` p75 | to capture | to capture | PostHog |
| `feedback_complete_ms` p75 | to capture | to capture | PostHog |
| Timeout path | none: the client waited 45 s | 12 s server budget, "Feedback is taking longer than usual." with Retry | code |

What changed:

- `/api/score` streams newline-delimited JSON when the client sends `Accept: application/x-ndjson`. Existing JSON clients (report retry, employer sittings, load test) are unchanged.
- The model emits readable blocks first: headline, What worked, What is missing, Say this next time. Scores and evidence come last and are only released after the integrity gate passes, so no partial number is ever visible.
- Each block appears the moment it is complete. Blocks still generating show a skeleton, not a spinner.
- The server budget is 12 s. A timeout returns `scoring_timeout`; the browser withdraws anything half shown and offers Retry. Retry sends the same request on a fresh stream. Automatic countdown retries do not run after a timeout.
- Employer sittings and locked answers never stream blocks.

Verified here: unit tests for the partial-JSON extractor (English, Arabic, keys inside quoted text), the NDJSON transport (partials, final, timeout, thrown failure, locked), `tsc --noEmit`, `next build`. Not verified here: an end-to-end stream against a live model, because this environment has no provider key and no Supabase project.

Model: the brief asks for the smallest model that passes the feedback quality gate. The gate is `npm run gate:feedback-quality` (`scripts/measure-consistency.mjs` with `EXPECT_AI=1`) against a deployment. Time to first word is dominated by `SCORING_REASONING`; trial `low` first, then a smaller model, and record the spread result here before keeping either. The Anthropic path is only active when `ENABLE_ANTHROPIC_FALLBACK=true`.

Acceptance for Section 1 is p75 under 1.5 s and 6 s on production. Sections 2 to 7 wait for that figure.

## Sections not started

- Section 2, Middle East edge region: needs Vercel project settings and the Supabase region check. Do not migrate Supabase without confirmation.
- Section 3, on-device transcription: Web Speech with typing fallback exists; audio-only server fallback does not.
- Section 4, build-time generation: `/practice/[roleId]` currently renders on demand; no model answers; no advert-hash cache.
- Section 5, page weight: no bundle budget in CI; `components/InterviewFlow.tsx` is the largest client module.
- Section 6, employer side: the report page runs per-request queries and signs video URLs on load.
- Section 7, database: `pg_stat_statements` and pooling need Supabase access.
